# multiagent_system
Catkin repository for multiagent_system course

After building:


To run, use the following command to start an empty gazebo instance:

$ roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch

If everything has been installed correctly, you should have two very simple maps/worlds that you can use in gazebo.
Input one or multiple turtle-bots within this map. At the moment, the project only moves one turtle-bot forward.
The goal at the moment is to implement an avoid and random-walk function for multiple turtlebots.



To then run the project, use the following command:

$ rosrun multiagent_system multiagent_system
